"Predicting nitrate concentrations in groundwater wells in North Carolina using temperature and rainfall"

This repository contains open-source code & text files.  This information will be archived when it is published.

Data used for this project is archived here: *not currently available*

## We address the following objective:

* Develop and test multiple models that predict nitrate contamination in private drinking water wells in the geographic regions of North Carolina based on temperature and precipitation records over the previous 180 days

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:** R scripts written by Randall Etheridge containing code to predict nitrate contamination in groundwater wells using rainfall and temperature records by random forest models (regression and classification) and linear regression models
